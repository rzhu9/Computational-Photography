\f0\fs24 \cf0 2. These images look the way they do because of the edge detection function used. It detected the change around its neighboring pixels and gave them an magnitude. This was then mapped to a color scale with red being high energy, and blue low energy. \
\
3. The seams (shown in black) are optimal because that occurs at minimal changing places between neighboring pixels. Usually the seams occur in mostly blue regions, because it has low energy.\
\
4. The zhu.4a.jpg had a very successful result. This is most likely because the algorithm was able to find the lowest energy. The style of picture is similar to the union terrance where it is easy to find a suitable seam in the blue sky. \
\
5. The zhu.5a.jpg had flaws which made it a poor choice for size reduction. The colors were not very contrasting, so peoples faces got removed. Also, there was too much going on in the whole image, which is also bad for finding the best seams. }
